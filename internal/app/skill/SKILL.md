# flow — task and session manager skill

## 1. What flow is

`flow` is a small CLI (assumed on `$PATH`) that the user uses to track
personal work and bootstrap per-task agent sessions. Claude is the default
provider; Codex is supported with `--agent codex` / `--codex`. Metadata (projects,
tasks, workdirs, provider, session IDs) lives in a single SQLite database at
`~/.flow/flow.db`. Free-form plan content lives on disk as markdown
"briefs" at `~/.flow/projects/<slug>/brief.md` and
`~/.flow/tasks/<slug>/brief.md`. Progress notes accumulate as dated
markdown files under each entity's `updates/` subdirectory. The user runs
one long-lived agent session per task in its own terminal tab, resumed via
`flow do <task>`.

You are speaking inside one of those agent sessions (or the user's
ambient "dispatch" session). Your job is to interpret the user's natural
language requests and turn them into the exact `flow` commands and file
edits they imply. You never edit `flow.db` directly. You never solve
problems during task intake — you interview, then write what the user
said.

> **Paths in this skill.** Every `~/.flow/...` path you see is the
> *default* layout. The flow root is configurable via `$FLOW_ROOT`;
> if it's set to something else, substitute that root in every path
> reference. The authoritative paths are always whatever `flow show
> task` / `flow show project` print under `brief:`, `updates:`,
> `kb:`, etc. — read those, don't reconstruct paths from prose.

## 1a. When invoked explicitly with no intent

If this skill is invoked without a trigger phrase — for example the
user typed `/flow` or asked you to load the flow skill but did not
say what they want done — DO NOT auto-run any workflow. Do not
silently call `flow list tasks`, do not enter §4.1 "start the day",
do not propose opening a task, do not start an intake interview.
The user just asked what this skill is for. Answer that question
first; let them choose what happens next.

**Behavior:**

1. In 2–3 sentences, describe what you can do for the user with
   flow under the hood — capture work as briefs, log progress
   notes, resume Claude/Codex sessions across days, track what they're
   waiting on. Frame it as your capabilities, not commands. The
   user does not need to learn flow's CLI.
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "What now?") to offer the main
   actions. Pick 3–4 options that fit the current state — for
   example:
   - "Show me what's on my plate" — runs §4.1 start-the-day.
   - "Add a new task" — runs §4.2 task intake.
   - "Add a project" — runs §4.3 project intake.
   - "Just exploring" — stop and wait.
3. Dispatch on the user's pick. If "Just exploring" or the user
   skips the question, stop and let them lead.

This section ONLY governs the bare-invocation case. Trigger-phrase
recipes in §4 ("what should I work on", "add a task", etc.) still
fire on natural-language requests — when the user already expressed
an intent, follow the matching recipe instead of re-asking via §1a.

## 2. The model

- **Projects** group related tasks. Every project has a name, a slug, a
  `work_dir` (a path on disk), a priority, a status (`active` or `done`),
  and a `brief.md` file describing the project's intent.
- **Tasks** are units of work. Every task has a name, a slug (short,
  user-chosen via `--slug` at creation time), a `work_dir` (mandatory —
  either the project's work_dir, a user-supplied path, or an auto-created
  `~/.flow/tasks/<slug>/workspace/` for explicitly adhoc tasks), a
  priority, a status (`backlog`, `in-progress`, `done`), an optional
  `project_slug`, an optional `waiting_on` freeform note, and a
  `brief.md`. Tasks also carry a `session_provider` (`claude` or `codex`)
  and a `session_id` once `flow do` has bootstrapped or captured a session
  for them. Codex may briefly be `in-progress` with an empty `session_id`
  while flow captures the id from Codex's session store. New task intake must choose an
  existing project when the work belongs to one; leave `project_slug`
  empty only when the user explicitly says it is adhoc/floating.
- **Playbooks** are reusable, runnable definitions. A playbook has a
  name, slug, work_dir, optional `project_slug`, and a `brief.md` that
  describes what each invocation should do. Each invocation creates a
  **playbook-run** — a task with `kind=playbook_run` — that has its
  own session, its own snapshotted `brief.md`, and its own
  `updates/`. Editing a playbook's `brief.md` does not affect past
  runs; runs are reproducible.
- **Workdirs** is a convenience registry of known local repo paths. It
  exists so this skill can match repo intent ("the budgeting app")
  to a path on disk. It records the local path, nickname, and Git origin
  remote when the path is a repo. It is not the source of truth for any
  task's work_dir — `tasks.work_dir` is.
- **Updates** are dated markdown files under
  `~/.flow/tasks/<slug>/updates/YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab>.md` (and the same under
  `projects/`). They are progress notes. They are written by you (this
  skill) via the `Write` tool when the user asks you to save a note. They
  are not in the database. They are permanent — archiving a task never
  deletes them.
- **Status is 3 values.** `backlog`, `in-progress`, `done`. There is no
  `blocked` state anymore. If the user is waiting on something or
  someone, set `waiting_on` (see §5.6).
- **Archive vs delete.** Archive means "hide from everyday active lists,
  but keep it as intentional history." Soft-delete means
  "delete/remove/trash this entity from normal flow views, but keep it
  recoverable." Use `flow archive` for set-aside history and
  `flow delete` for delete/remove/trash requests.

## 3. First-run detection (once per session)

The **first time in a session** you're about to run a `flow` command,
run `flow list tasks` or `flow list projects` as a probe:

- If the command **succeeds** (even with zero results): flow is
  initialized. Proceed normally. **Do not check again this session.**
- If the command **errors** with a message about a missing database:
  the user hasn't initialized flow yet. Use `AskUserQuestion` (header:
  "Set up flow?", options: "Yes, set it up" / "No, not now") with
  question text describing flow as a personal task and session
  manager that will store its data in `$FLOW_ROOT` (or `~/.flow` if
  unset). On "Yes", run `flow init` yourself and then enter the
  **first-run coaching** below. On "No", stop.

### First-run coaching

After `flow init` succeeds for a brand-new user, walk them through the
basics in this order:

1. **Explain what just happened.** "`flow init` created `~/.flow/` with
   an empty database and 5 knowledge-base files."

2. **Create their first project.** "Let's set up a project — what's the
   main thing you're working on right now?" Then enter the §5.3
   add-project interview. This gets them a project and at least one task
   immediately.

3. **Show how to start work.** After the first task exists, use
   `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Open it now?", options:
   "Open it now" / "Later, just save") to ask whether to run
   `flow do <slug>`. Briefly explain in the question: a dedicated
   agent session gets the brief, updates, and repo conventions
   automatically. If "Open it now", proceed to §4.4. If "Later",
   stop here.

4. **Mention the knowledge base.** "As we work together, I'll
   automatically note durable facts about you and your org in
   `~/.flow/kb/`. These notes carry across sessions so future agent
   conversations have context without you repeating yourself."

5. **Point to daily use.** "From any session, just say 'what should I
   work on' or 'start my day' and I'll pull up your task list. Say
   'add a task' to capture new work."

Keep the coaching conversational and brief — don't dump all five points
in one wall of text. Let the user respond between steps. If they want
to skip ahead ("I know, just set it up"), respect that and stop
coaching.

## 4. Command reference

This is a terse cheat sheet. Use `flow <command> --help` for up-to-date
flags.

  flow unarchive      <ref>
  flow delete         <ref>
  flow restore        <ref>
  (flow edit, archive, unarchive, delete, and restore also accept playbook refs)

Workdirs
  flow workdir list
  flow workdir add <path> [--name <nickname>]   (captures origin remote if present)
  flow workdir remove <path>
  flow workdir scan [<root>] [--add]            (backfills origin remotes for detected repos)

Orchestration (parent-child agents — see §4.17)
  flow spawn <name> [--parent <slug>] [--prompt <text>] [--project <slug>]
                    [--work-dir <path>] [--slug <s>] [--priority h|m|l]
                    [--agent claude|codex] [--no-open]
       Create a task (parent_slug auto-set when --parent is given) and
       immediately open it in a new tab. The prompt becomes the task's
       brief "What" section so the spawned agent starts with context.

  flow tell <task-slug> "<message>" [--from <slug-or-label>]
       Append a stamped message to ~/.flow/tasks/<slug>/inbox.md. The
       receiving agent reads new entries at its next SessionStart and
       acts on them. Use this to nudge a sibling task without spawning
       a new conversation.

  flow wait <task-slug> --until <state> [--timeout <dur>]
       Block until the task reaches the requested state. <state> can be
       a task lifecycle (backlog|in-progress|done) or an agent runtime
       state (running|waiting|idle|dead|released). Uses /ws/events for
       live updates; short-circuits when already in state.
```

All references (`<ref>`) resolve by **exact slug match only**. There is
no fuzzy or substring matching. Use `--slug` to pick a short, memorable
slug at creation time (e.g. `--slug caas-exit`). If omitted, a slug is
auto-generated from the name (truncated to ~6 words).

## 4a. Interactive choices (use `AskUserQuestion` everywhere)

**This section overrides any inline prose phrasing later in the skill.**
If a later section says "offer X", "ask Y", or "confirm Z", that
always means "invoke `AskUserQuestion` with appropriate options" —
never a prose question typed into the chat.

Every choice the user makes — always AskUserQuestion, never a prose
question. Yes/no confirmations, pick-one-of-several, priority, slug
suggestions, project attachment, mutation confirmations, "want me to
do X?" — every single one runs through the tool so the user can click
to select instead of typing. Common patterns:

| Pattern | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Yes / No | Two options with contextual labels (e.g. "Save it" / "Revise", "Open now" / "Not now") |
| Pick from list | One option per candidate (tasks, projects, slugs) |
| Priority | "High", "Medium", "Low" |
| Mutation confirm | "Yes, do it" / "No, wait" with the action named in the description |

Keep `header` under 12 chars. Put enough context in `question` so
the choice is clear without scrolling back. If the user already
answered in their message, don't re-ask — just use their answer.

**Prose questions are deprecated.** Don't write "Want me to do X?"
or "Should I do Y?" or "(yes/no)" in chat — those force the user to
type a free-text reply. The tool produces clickable options; always
prefer the tool.

**Mid-interview drift.** Within an open-ended interview (intake,
deferred-section prompt), the parent question may be free-form
("Why?", "Done when?") but follow-up clarifications often narrow into
enumerable choices (architectures, install methods, yes/no). The
moment a sub-question has 2–4 discrete options, switch to
AskUserQuestion. Don't keep typing prose just because you started in
prose. The "interview" framing governs the *opening* question; every
narrowing inside it follows the same always-AskUserQuestion rule as
the rest of the skill.

## 5. Core workflows

These are the load-bearing part of the skill. When the user says one of
the trigger phrases, follow the corresponding recipe exactly.

### 4.1 Start the day

**Triggers:** "start my day", "what should I do today", "what am I
working on", "where did I leave off", "give me a status".

**Recipe:**

1. Run `flow list projects` and `flow list tasks --status in-progress`.
2. Run `flow list tasks --status backlog --priority high`.
3. Read the `waiting_on` and stale markers in the tasks output.
4. Summarize in 4 sections:
   - **In flight** (`in-progress`): 1 bullet per task, include any ⚠
     stale marker and any `[waiting: ...]` note.
   - **High-priority backlog**: 1 bullet per backlog task marked high.
   - **Waiting on someone**: pull out tasks with `waiting_on` set so the
     user can see the whole block at once.
   - **Stale** (anything with the ⚠ marker): call these out explicitly.
   - **Active playbooks**: any playbook with a run in the past 7 days.
     Pull from `flow list runs --since 7d` grouped by playbook; show
     playbook slug + most recent run timestamp. Skip if there are no
     runs in the window — don't show an empty header.
5. Use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user pick which task to work on.
   List each in-progress and high-priority backlog task as an option
   (label = slug, description = one-line summary). Include an "Add a
   new task" option if appropriate.

Do not auto-run `flow do` after listing. Wait for the user to pick.

### 4.2 Add a task — INTERVIEW MODE (mandatory)

**Triggers:** "add a task", "new task", "track this work", "let me add a
flow task for X".

**The interview is the whole point.** The skill's value vs. "just run
`flow add task`" is that you interview the user before saving. You NEVER
solution during intake. You NEVER fill blanks with guesses. If a section
is unclear, ask. If the user says "I don't know yet", write "Open
question: ..." in the brief and move on.

**Required sections (always asked, in this order):**

1. **Name** — one-sentence description of the work. Example: "Add OAuth
   login to the budgeting app."
2. **Slug** — short, memorable, ASCII. Use AskUserQuestion to suggest 2–3
   candidates derived from the name. User picks one or types a custom
   slug.
3. **Project or adhoc.** Before saving, tie the task to an existing
   project whenever it naturally belongs to one. If it does not belong to
   any project, capture that explicitly as adhoc/floating rather than
   silently omitting `--project`.
4. **Where?** — work_dir for the task. Use the §6 recipe. If a project is
   selected, default to that project's `work_dir`.
5. **Priority** — High / Medium / Low via AskUserQuestion. Default Medium.

**Optional sections (offered, can be deferred):**

After the four required fields, use AskUserQuestion:

> "Want to capture more detail now (Why, Done when, Out of scope, Open
> questions), or defer until you start the task?"
> - Detail now (recommended for tasks you'll start later)
> - Defer until you start the task

**Detail now:** run the rest of the original §4.2 sections — Why, Done
when, Out of scope, Open questions — and draft the full brief. Use the
full task-brief template from §7.

**Defer:** save the task with a thin brief (template in §7). The
bootstrap-time prompt (§9 deferred-section prompt) will walk the user
through the missing sections when they `flow do` the task — at which
point the user has more context and is more motivated to think about
acceptance criteria.

**Confirmation flow** (both paths):
- Show the drafted brief.
- AskUserQuestion: "Brief — Save it / Revise"
- Save → `flow add task ...` → update the brief stub the binary
  just wrote with the drafted content (use `Edit` with
  `replace_all: true` after a single `Read`, or `Write` after a
  single `Read` — both are 2 tool calls; pick whichever feels
  natural).

**Then, BEFORE calling `flow add task`:**

- **Ask for a short slug.** Suggest 2–3 slug candidates derived from
  the task name (e.g. for "Add OAuth to budgeting app" suggest `oauth`,
  `auth-budget`, `oauth-budget`). Present them via `AskUserQuestion`
  so the user can click one (the "Other" option lets them type a custom
  slug). If the user picks Other and leaves it blank, omit `--slug`.
- **Project attachment.** Use `AskUserQuestion` with one option per
  existing project (label = slug, description = project name) plus an
  explicit "Adhoc / no project" option. If there are no projects, say
  that the task will be adhoc unless the user wants to create a project
  first. Do not silently create floating tasks.
- **Priority.** Use `AskUserQuestion` with "High", "Medium (Recommended)",
  "Low". Skip if the user already stated priority.
- **`--mkdir`** if the `work_dir` doesn't exist yet. Use `AskUserQuestion`
  with "Yes, create it" / "No, I'll fix the path".

**Draft the brief. Show it to the user.** Then use `AskUserQuestion`
(header: "Brief", options: "Save it" / "Revise") to confirm. Do not
run `flow add task` until the user picks "Save it". If they pick
"Revise", ask what to change, update the draft, and re-confirm.

**After `flow add task` succeeds**, it will print the task slug and
the absolute path to a stub `brief.md`. The flow is **Read once, then
Edit/Write**: Claude's `Write` and `Edit` tools both require a prior
`Read` of any existing file before mutating it (this is the harness's
guard against accidental overwrites). For brand-new tasks the stub
contents are predictable, so a single `Read` followed by either:
- `Edit` with `replace_all: true` (replaces the whole stub body), or
- `Write` (overwrites in full)

…is the right pattern. Use this literal template:

```markdown
# <name>

## What
<one sentence>

## Why
<short paragraph>

## Where
work_dir: <path>

## Done when
- <criterion 1>
- <criterion 2>
- <criterion 3>

## Out of scope
- <non-goal 1>

## Open questions
- <question 1>

---
*Before you start on this task, read CLAUDE.md in the work_dir.*
```

**Tag step — always ask, easy to skip.** Right after the brief
saves — before offering "Open now?" — you MUST surface a single
tag question. The user gets to pick "Skip" with one click; that
makes the step optional from the *user's* side, not yours. Do NOT
pre-skip this step on the user's behalf.

1. Run `flow list tags` to discover the user's existing vocabulary.
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Tags?", `multiSelect: true`):
   - If existing tags came back: include the top 3 (most-used) as
     options labelled `#<tag>` with description "N tasks already
     have this tag". Add an option "New tag(s)" — when the user
     picks this via Other, they type comma-separated values. Add a
     final option "Skip — no tags" so the step is one click to
     bypass.
   - If no tags exist yet: just ask "Tag this task? (optional)"
     with options "Yes, set tags" / "Skip — no tags". On "Yes",
     prompt the user (prose is fine, there's nothing to suggest)
     for comma-separated values.
3. If the user picks any combination of existing tags and/or
   typed values, run `flow update task <slug> --tag <t1> --tag <t2> ...`.
4. If the user picks "Skip", do nothing — and move on to the
   "Open now?" question without dwelling.

The ONLY case where you may legitimately skip surfacing the question
is when the user has explicitly said something like "no more
questions, just save it" or "just save it" earlier in the same
turn. Otherwise, ask. Don't second-guess; preserve their right to
skip by giving them the click, not by pre-deciding for them.

Finally, offer how to proceed with the new task. The shape of the
question depends on whether THIS Claude/Codex session is already bound to
another flow task. Probe with `flow show task` (no arg). If it
errors with `not bound to a task`, the current session is unbound
(dispatch); otherwise it already belongs to the task it resolved.

**Unbound session — three options.** Use `AskUserQuestion`
(header: "Open now?"):

- **Yes, in a new tab** — proceed to the §4.4 recipe
  (`flow do <slug>`, which spawns a fresh tab and flips the task
  to in-progress). Pick when the work hasn't started yet.
- **Continue here (bind this session)** — keep working in this
  conversation; bind it to the new task so future
  `flow do <slug>` resumes here. Pick when the work motivating
  the task has already begun in this session — which is the
  common case when intake was triggered by §4.14 from the
  SessionStart hook intercept. Run **`flow do --here <slug>`**
  immediately (the binary reads the current agent session id, binds,
  and flips status to in-progress in one shot).
- **No, keep in backlog** — save and stop. Pick for future work
  the user won't touch today.

**Status follow-through — the task should not be left in backlog
after either Yes-path picks.** `flow do` and `flow do --here` both
flip the task to in-progress as part of the bind. If the work is
purely retrospective (the task exists to *record* something
already complete in this session — e.g. "track the script I just
wrote", "register what we just shipped"), the right next step
after Continue-here is to immediately offer §4.7 closure
(`AskUserQuestion`: "Mark done now?") so the task moves
backlog → in-progress → done in one flow. The task should never
sit in in-progress for retrospective records — its purpose is
already fulfilled the moment it's created and bound.

**Bound session — two options ONLY.** Use `AskUserQuestion`
(header: "Open now?", options: "Yes, open it" / "No, keep in
backlog"). Do **not** offer "Continue here" / "Bind this session"
/ "Rebind" / any variant. Reasons:

- A session_id can belong to at most one task (partial unique
  index). Binding this session to a second task would either
  orphan the prior task's transcript or violate the index.
- `flow do --here` REJECTS this case at the binary level even
  with `--force` — there is no escape hatch. Offering an option
  the binary will refuse is bad UX.
- The user's intent is almost always "open the new task in a
  separate tab" (Yes-new-tab). If they actually want to switch
  this session's task ownership, that's a different workflow
  (release the prior binding first) and must be asked
  explicitly, not slipped in as a third option here.

On "Yes", proceed to §4.4. On "No", stop.

> **Different-tab hint.** "Continue here" only ever applies in
> dispatch sessions and only ever attaches the *current* session.
> If the user is creating a task to track work that happened in
> a *different* Claude/Codex session they have open elsewhere, they
> need to switch to that other tab and run `flow do --here
> <slug>` there.

### 4.3 Add a project

**Triggers:** "add a project", "new project", "track this initiative".

Similar to §5.2 but shorter. Sections: **What / Why / Where / Scope**.
No "done when" (projects are ongoing containers, not completable units).
Confirm the `work_dir`. Draft. Show. Wait for "save it". Run `flow add
project`, then update the stub `brief.md` with the drafted content
(Read once, then Edit/Write — same pattern as §5.2).

Do not offer `flow do` on the project itself — you `do` tasks, not
projects.

**MANDATORY follow-up: create at least one task under the project.**
A project with zero tasks is a dead container — the user will forget
why they made it. Immediately after `flow add project` succeeds:

1. Say: "Project created. A project needs at least one task to be
   useful — what's the first concrete thing you want to do under
   <project-slug>?" (Use the project's actual slug.)
2. When the user answers, enter the task-intake workflow (§5.2)
   with `--project <slug>` pre-filled. Interview for What / Why /
   Where / Done when / Out of scope / Open questions as usual.
3. If the user says "I don't know yet" or "just create the project
   for now", DO NOT create a placeholder task and DO NOT silently
   drop it. Instead, explicitly tell them: "OK, no task for now —
   just tell me when you're ready to add one and I'll set it up."
   Do not surface the underlying `flow` commands.
4. If the user describes several tasks at once, create them all via
   sequential §5.2 interviews. Don't try to batch-extract; one
   interview per task.
5. Only after the first task exists (or the user has explicitly
   declined), use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Open it now?", options:
   "Yes, open it" / "No, keep in backlog") to offer
   `flow do <first-task>`. If "Yes", proceed to §4.4. If "No", stop.

The rule is about pushing the user one step further than
`flow add project` — project creation is not a complete action on
its own, it's the start of a two-or-more-step workflow.

### 4.4 Start / resume work on a task

**Triggers — any of these means "run `flow do <ref>`":**
- "resume X" / "pick up X" / "continue X" / "open X"
- "let me work on X" / "lets work on X" / "let's work on X"
- "lets do X" / "let's do X" / "do X" / "do the X"
- "start X" / "start on X" / "begin X" / "get going on X"
- A bare "`flow do X`" typed as command-like input

**Recipe:**

1. **Ask the user which session mode they want** before running anything.
   Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool so the user can click to choose:

   ```
   AskUserQuestion({
     questions: [{
       question: "Which session mode for <task-slug>?",
       header: "Session mode",
       options: [
         { label: "Regular",          description: "Normal agent session with tool-approval prompts (safer)" },
         { label: "Skip permissions", description: "Pass --dangerously-skip-permissions (faster, no prompts)" }
       ],
       multiSelect: false
     }]
   })
   ```

   If the user already specified a mode in their request (e.g. "do X
   with skip permissions", "do X normally", "auto mode"), use that —
   don't re-ask. If they explicitly ask for Codex, append `--agent codex`;
   otherwise default to the task's stored provider or Claude.
2. Run: `flow do <user's ref>`. Pass the slug the user gave as one
   positional argument. Resolution is exact slug match. Append
   `--dangerously-skip-permissions` if the user chose skip-permissions;
   for Codex this maps to Codex's
   `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. Stored task
   `permission_mode` is provider-neutral: `default` means prompt on
   request with sandboxing for Codex, `auto` means no approval prompts
   while keeping Codex sandboxed, and `bypass` disables both Codex
   approvals and sandboxing.
   Append `--agent codex` only when the user requested Codex or when
   creating/running a task already stored with `session_provider=codex`.
3. If the command errors with "no task matching", ask the user to clarify
   or offer `flow add task` instead.
4. Pass `--fresh` ONLY if the user explicitly asked for a fresh session
   (e.g. "start over", "fresh session", "--fresh"). Never on your own.

**After `flow do` succeeds** it has already spawned a terminal tab.
Your job is done. Report "opened tab: <title>"
and stop. Do NOT:

- Run diagnostic commands like `pgrep`, `ls ~/.claude/projects/...`,
  or `osascript` to try to verify the tab opened.
- Try to spawn a terminal tab yourself with osascript or zellij. `flow do` already
  did this.
- Re-run `flow do` unless the user explicitly asked for a retry.
- Try to peek into the new session's activity. It's a separate
  conversation; you have no access to it.

If `flow do` itself errored (rc != 0), relay the error and stop. Do
not attempt workarounds; the user will decide what to do next.

#### Special case: live-session guard

`flow do` refuses to spawn when the task's `session_id` is already
running in another Claude process — typically because the user has the
task's tab open elsewhere and forgot. The error names the running
session ID and points at `--force`. When you see it:

1. Tell the user, in plain language, that the task already has a
   running session in another tab. Suggest they switch to that tab.
2. Offer via AskUserQuestion (header: "Open another?", options:
   "Switch to the existing tab" / "Open another anyway") whether to
   bypass the guard. On "Open another anyway", retry with `--force`.

Don't auto-retry with `--force`. The guard exists because two live
sessions on the same task fork the conversation and cause confusion;
bypassing it should be an explicit choice.

#### Special case: macOS Accessibility error from the Terminal.app backend

When `flow do` runs from a stock Terminal.app shell and macOS hasn't
granted Accessibility, the binary returns a multi-line error that
explicitly names "Terminal" as the app needing the grant and includes
a `open "x-apple.systempreferences:..."` URL to jump straight to the
right Settings pane. When you see that error:

1. **Trust the error verbatim.** It says "Terminal" because macOS
   attributes Accessibility to the responsible parent app, which is
   Terminal.app — NOT Claude Code, NOT the flow binary. Do not advise
   the user to toggle "Claude" or "flow"; that wastes their time.
2. **Open the Accessibility pane for them**: run
   `open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_Accessibility"`.
3. **Tell the user, in plain language**, what to do next: enable the
   toggle for "Terminal" in the list (or click + and add Terminal.app
   from `/System/Applications/Utilities/` if it isn't shown).
4. **Wait for the user to confirm** they've granted it. Don't poll
   or retry on a timer.
5. When they confirm, retry the original `flow do` invocation with
   the same flags they originally chose (session mode, `--fresh`,
   etc.).

Macros for this: do not invent more candidate apps to toggle, do not
suggest the user reinstall flow, do not attempt to grant Accessibility
yourself. macOS guards Accessibility deliberately — there is no CLI to
self-grant it, and Claude cannot bypass that.

### 4.5 Save a progress note

**Triggers:** "save a note", "log progress", "write an update", "note
that…", "record that I…", "document that I just…".

**Recipe:**

1. Compose a filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab-short-title>.md`. The kebab
   title is 3–5 words summarizing the note. Use today's date.
2. Compose the note content. **Under 10 lines.** Exactly two paragraphs
   plus an optional blockers line:
   - Paragraph 1: what got done. Specific. No hedging.
   - Paragraph 2: what's next or what the user is thinking about next.
   - Optional blockers: "Blocked on: <X>" if applicable.
3. **Show the filename and the content to the user.** Then use
   `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Save note?", options: "Save it" /
   "Revise") to confirm. Do not write silently.
4. Determine the entity:
   - For a **regular task**, notes go under
     `~/.flow/tasks/<slug>/updates/`. Slug from `flow show task` (no
     arg, reverse-lookup) or asked.
   - For a **playbook run**, notes ALSO go under
     `~/.flow/tasks/<run-slug>/updates/` (runs are tasks).
   - For a **playbook definition**, notes go under
     `~/.flow/playbooks/<slug>/updates/` for cross-invocation observations
     ("noticed flaky output when X", "next iteration should consolidate
     steps 2 and 3"). Use this when capturing things that should inform
     the playbook itself, not a single run.
5. Use the `Write` tool to create
   `~/.flow/tasks/<slug>/updates/<filename>.md` with the confirmed
   content. If the user is noting project-level progress, use
   `~/.flow/projects/<slug>/updates/` instead.
6. Confirm to the user: "saved: <absolute path>".

Do NOT run any `flow` command for this — updates are just files.

### 4.6 Waiting on someone

**Triggers:** "I'm waiting on <X>", "blocked on <Y>", "stuck until <Z>",
"need <person> to respond", "pinged <X>".

**Recipe:** run `flow update task <current-task> --waiting "<who or what>"`. The
status stays `in-progress`; `waiting_on` is just a freeform note that
will show up in `flow list` and `flow show task` so the user remembers.

**Unblocking triggers:** "X came back", "got the answer", "unblocked",
"no longer waiting on X". Before mutating, confirm via
`AskUserQuestion` (header: "Clear waiting?", options:
"Yes, clear it" / "Wait, not yet"). On "Yes", run
`flow update task <task> --clear-waiting`. On "Wait, not yet", stop
and let the user clarify. (This matches the §8 "do not mark done
without confirmation" anti-pattern philosophy — clearing `waiting_on`
is a state mutation and deserves the same explicit click.)

Do not infer the task slug silently — use `flow show task` (no arg)
to discover the bound task, otherwise use `AskUserQuestion` listing
in-progress tasks as options to disambiguate which task this is for.

### 4.7 Mark done

**Triggers — explicit:** "mark X done", "finish X", "X is done",
"close out X", "wrap up X".

**Triggers — wrap-up signals (treat as candidate triggers, then
confirm via AskUserQuestion):** "shipped", "PR merged", "deployed",
"released", "wrapped up", "that's working", "bug fixed", "test
passes", "ready to ship", "all good now", "we're good", "that did
it".

**Why closing matters — read this before treating `flow done` as
bookkeeping.** `flow done` is not just a status flip. It runs a
headless Claude sweep over the task's transcript that distills
durable facts into the user's KB (`~/.flow/kb/`) and, when the task
has a project, writes a project update at
`~/.flow/projects/<slug>/updates/` summarizing what got done and
why. **If a task never closes, that distillation never happens.**
Learnings stay locked in the transcript and never reach central
tracking — which is precisely the value the user installed flow to
capture. Treat closure as the load-bearing moment of the workflow,
not a clean-up afterthought. Letting work wrap up without prompting
closure is a silent loss of durable knowledge.

**Recipe:**

1. Confirm via `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Mark done?", options:
   "Yes, mark it done" / "No, not yet") before mutating. Per §8,
   never mark done without explicit confirmation — even if the user
   says "great, I finished that".
2. If the user hasn't just saved a progress note, use
   `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Closing note?", options:
   "Yes, save a note first" / "No, just mark done") to offer.
   On "Yes", run the §4.5 recipe first, then continue.
3. Run `flow done <ref>`. **Do not close the terminal tab** and **do
   not kill the agent session** — `flow done` deliberately leaves
   both intact. The session_id stays on the task row so a future
   reopen can still resume it. The close-out sweep runs after the
   status flip; relay any NUDGE block `flow done` prints back to
   the user verbatim.

**Recognizing natural close-out moments — passive workflow.**

This is a passive workflow that runs alongside §4.10 (KB scoop) and
§4.11 (scope-creep): you watch the conversation for signals that
substantive work is wrapping up even when the user hasn't said the
word "done". When a signal fires, proactively offer closure via
`AskUserQuestion` — don't wait for the user to remember.

**When to fire:**

- Wrap-up phrasing from the wrap-up trigger list above.
- A clear milestone just landed (PR merged, deploy succeeded, all
  tests green, last open question on the brief resolved) and the
  user has moved to small-talk or signaled satisfaction ("perfect",
  "that's it", "nice", "thanks").
- The user references a separate task in a way that implies a
  context switch ("now let me look at <other thing>") — offer to
  close the current one first if its work is at a coherent stopping
  point.

**When NOT to fire:**

- Mid-debugging or mid-implementation, even if a partial milestone
  was hit. Closure is for coherent stopping points, not every green
  test.
- The user explicitly said "more work coming" earlier this session —
  remember that signal and don't re-ask on the same thread.
- The very first turns of a session — the user just opened the task;
  let the work happen first.

**Recipe:**

1. Pause your current line of response.
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Mark done?", options:
   "Yes — close it and run the close-out sweep" / "Not yet, more
   work coming"). The "Yes" option's description should name the
   sweep: "flow done distills KB entries and a project update from
   this transcript — closing now persists what we learned this
   session."
3. On "Yes", proceed to the §4.7 recipe above (closing-note offer,
   then `flow done`).
4. On "Not yet", accept the answer and don't re-ask on the same
   thread of work in the same session.

**Playbook-specific notes:**

- **Run-tasks** (kind=playbook_run) support `flow done <run-slug>` like
  any task. Their close-out sweep also runs and can capture
  playbook-specific learnings.
- Note: **playbook definitions are never "done" — they're archived.**
  When a playbook is no longer in use, run `flow archive <playbook-slug>`.
  There is no `flow done playbook` command.

### 4.8 Archive / soft-delete / cleanup

**Triggers:** "archive X", "clean up", "clean up my done tasks", "hide
finished work", "delete X", "remove X", "trash X", "restore X".

**Recipe:**

- **Archive vs delete choice.** If the user says archive/hide/clean up
  done work, archive. If the user says delete/remove/trash, use
  Soft-delete. If intent is ambiguous, ask via `AskUserQuestion`
  whether they want "Archive it" or "Move to trash".
- Single task/project: confirm via `AskUserQuestion` (header:
  "Archive?", options: "Yes, archive `<slug>`" / "No, keep it"),
  then on "Yes" run `flow archive <ref>`.
- Bulk "archive everything done": run `flow list tasks --status done`.
  Show the list to the user. Then, unless the user already said
  "archive all done" explicitly, use `AskUserQuestion` (header:
  "Archive all?", options: "Yes, archive all listed" / "Pick one by
  one" / "Cancel"). On "Yes", iterate and archive them all, printing
  each action. On "Pick one by one", run a single-task `AskUserQuestion`
  for each. On "Cancel", stop.
- If the user regrets it: `flow unarchive <ref>`.

Archive never deletes files on disk — brief.md and updates/ remain. Make
sure the user knows this so they don't worry about losing notes.

**Soft-delete:**
- Single task/project/playbook: confirm via `AskUserQuestion` (header:
  "Delete?", options: "Yes, move to trash" / "No, keep it"), then on
  "Yes" run `flow delete <ref>`. This sets `deleted_at`; normal lists
  and the UI hide it, but the row and markdown files remain.
- Use `task/<slug>`, `project/<slug>`, or `playbook/<slug>` when the
  same slug may exist in multiple entity types.
- To inspect deleted work, use `flow list tasks --deleted`,
  `flow list projects --deleted`, or `flow list playbooks --deleted`.
  Use `--include-deleted` when you need active and deleted rows together.
- To undo it, run `flow restore <ref>`. Restore clears `deleted_at` only;
  it does not unarchive archived work. If the user asks to restore the
  wrong thing, list `--deleted` rows first and ask them to pick.

**Playbooks:**
- `flow archive <playbook-slug>` hides the playbook from
  `flow list playbooks` but does not affect past runs (they're independent
  task rows). Past runs can be archived independently with
  `flow archive <run-slug>`.
- "Bulk clean up done runs" pattern: `flow list runs --status done`,
  then archive each.

### 4.9 Weekly review

**Triggers:** "weekly review", "week in review", "what did I ship this
week", "friday review".

**Recipe:**

1. `flow list tasks --status done --since monday` — what shipped.
2. `flow list tasks --status in-progress` — what's still in flight. For
   each one, read the newest file in its `updates/` directory (via the
   `Read` tool) to summarize the latest state in 1 line.
3. Call out any `⚠` stale tasks and any `waiting_on` tasks explicitly.
4. `flow list tasks --status backlog --priority high` — what's queued.
5. `flow workdir list` — surface any workdir that hasn't been used in
   30+ days; mention these as "consider archiving" candidates.
6. `flow list runs --since monday` — group by playbook slug, count runs,
   pull each playbook's most-recent run timestamp.

Produce a digest in this exact shape:

```
## Shipped this week
- <task> — <one-line outcome>

## In flight
- <task> — <latest-update summary>  [⚠ stale if applicable]

## Stalled / waiting
- <task> — waiting on: <who/what>

## Next up
- <task> — <why it's high priority>

## Workdir hygiene
- <path> — untouched since <date>

## Playbook activity
- <playbook-slug> — N runs this week, most recent <date>
```

Do not solve anything during a weekly review — it's a reporting
workflow, not a planning workflow.

### 4.10 Listening for knowledge-base facts (scoop mode)

This is a **passive** workflow — it runs alongside every other workflow
in §5, continuously, without the user asking for it.

**What flow's knowledge base is:**
Five markdown files under `~/.flow/kb/`, seeded by `flow init`:

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `user.md` | Durable facts about the user — role, preferences, working style, constraints, availability |
| `org.md` | Company, team, structure, people the user interacts with |
| `products.md` | What the org ships — product lines, modules, features, releases |
| `processes.md` | How the org works — tools, conventions, rituals, review rules |
| `business.md` | Customers, business model, revenue, deals, market positioning |

These files are surfaced in `flow show task` and `flow show project`
output under a `kb:` section, so execution sessions can read them.

**How to decide whether a user statement belongs in the KB:**

Listen for statements that are **durable facts**, not transient state.
Bucket them by these signals:

| User says something like… | Goes to |
|---|---|
| "I'm the / my role is / I prefer / I hate / I always / I never" | `user.md` |
| "our team / my manager is / we have N people / <name> is / reports to" | `org.md` |
| "our product / we ship / feature X / module Y / next release" | `products.md` |
| "we use X for / our process / every Friday / we deploy on / review rule" | `processes.md` |
| "our customers / <customer> asked / revenue / contract / margin / market" | `business.md` |

**The scoop rule: append without asking.** If you hear a durable fact,
use Read to load the matching file, check it's not already there, then
Write an appended entry. Never pause to ask "should I record this?".
Just do it, then announce quietly in one line:

> noted in kb/org.md: "<short paraphrase>"

**Entry format — copy this exactly:**
```
- YYYY-MM-DD — <short quote or paraphrase of what the user said>
```

One line per entry. Keep it terse. Quote the user's actual words where
possible. If the fact is a list (e.g. "our products are A, B, C"),
write one entry per item rather than cramming them into a single line.

**Guardrails (non-negotiable):**

1. **Only durable facts.** "I'm tired today" is not durable. "I prefer
   async communication" is. When in doubt, don't record.
2. **Deduplicate.** Read the file first. If the same fact (even
   paraphrased) is already there, don't append a duplicate.
3. **Never invent.** Only record what the user literally said or clearly
   implied. Do not embellish, extrapolate, or guess.
4. **Never edit existing entries.** Append only. If a fact changes, add
   a new dated entry noting the change — the file is an append-only log
   so readers can see evolution.
5. **One bucket per fact.** If a fact plausibly fits two categories, pick
   the more specific one. Do not cross-post.
6. **Privacy.** KB files may contain personal or org-sensitive info. If
   the user initializes a git repo inside `~/.flow/`, remind them to add
   `kb/` to `.gitignore`.
7. **When helping across many tasks**, read the KB files once per session
   and re-read only if you wrote new entries. They're not load-bearing
   for every turn — but they're load-bearing for "who is this user,
   what is their context" decisions.

**When to read the KB — lazy-load only:**

The KB files are **not** loaded at session start. The SessionStart hook
and the §9 bootstrap contract both explicitly skip them. Read a kb file
only when the current question in front of you actually needs that
category of fact. Signals that it's time to Read one:

- The user mentions a person, product, tool, or customer name and you
  don't know who/what they are → read `org.md` / `products.md` /
  `business.md` as appropriate.
- You're composing a task brief / project brief / progress note and
  want to reflect the user's working style accurately → read `user.md`.
- The user asks "how do we usually do X?" or "what's our convention
  for Y?" → read `processes.md`.
- A brief or CLAUDE.md uses terminology you don't recognize (e.g.
  an internal codename, a product term, a legacy component name) →
  read the relevant kb file for definitions.
- You're generating cross-cutting advice ("how should I approach
  this?") that would benefit from context about the user's role,
  organization, or product suite.

Signals it's NOT time to read the KB:

- The user ran a one-shot mutation command (`flow done`, `flow archive`,
  `flow delete`, `flow restore`, `flow update task`, etc.) and you're
  just relaying the result.
- The current task is purely mechanical and self-contained ("run the
  tests", "fix the obvious typo").
- You already read the relevant file earlier this session and nothing
  new has been written to it since.

**Read at most the specific file you need, not all 5.** If you need
`org.md` to identify someone, don't also preemptively Read the other
four. Load on demand, one file at a time.

**Writing (scoop mode) is still eager.** The lazy rule is for reading.
When you hear a durable fact, append it to the matching kb file
immediately — that doesn't require the file to have been loaded first.
Read-Write just means "load, check for duplicates, write" as a single
sequence at the moment the fact is heard.

**Auxiliary files in entity directories** (any `.md` files in
`tasks/<slug>/`, `projects/<slug>/`, or `playbooks/<slug>/` other than
`brief.md` and the contents of `updates/`) are surfaced by `flow show`
under an `other:` section. Apply the same lazy-load discipline as KB
files: load them on demand when relevant to the work, not preemptively.

**Past tasks and projects can be referenced too.** `flow list tasks` and
`flow list projects` default to non-archived, non-deleted active rows;
done, archived, and deleted rows need explicit flags: `--status done` for
completed work, `--include-archived` to include archived rows,
`--deleted` to see only soft-deleted rows, and `--include-deleted` to
include active plus soft-deleted rows. `flow show task <slug>` and
`flow transcript <slug>` work on done/archived/deleted tasks too.

### 4.11 Scope-creep detection (passive — surface via AskUserQuestion)

This is a **passive** workflow like §5.10 — you watch the session as it
unfolds and intervene only when the evidence is strong. When you
intervene, the surfacing mechanism is `AskUserQuestion` (never a
prose "want me to...?" question). Its purpose is to keep a task's
transcript and update log focused, instead of letting unrelated work
pile up under whichever task happens to own the current terminal tab.

**When to consider firing:**

Fire when the *work itself* (not a single question) has clearly moved
off the bootstrapped task. Concretely, any of these is sufficient
evidence:

- You've made Edit/Write calls to files in a directory tree that isn't
  under the bound task's `work_dir` and isn't covered by its brief.
- You've spent two or more turns debugging a product, service, or
  repo that the brief doesn't mention.
- The user has introduced a new, named line of investigation ("while
  we're here, can you also look at <unrelated thing>") and begun
  giving it more than a single turn's attention.

**When NOT to fire (false positives to avoid):**

- A one-off tangential question answered in a single turn ("btw what
  does X mean?") — not drift, just curiosity.
- Reading/Read-tool usage outside the work_dir — reading is research,
  not work-migration. The trigger is write-side evidence.
- Natural debugging that requires touching nearby infrastructure the
  brief reasonably implies (e.g. a test helper in a sibling dir).
- The very first turn after session start — you don't yet know what
  "normal" looks like for this task.

**Recipe:**

1. When you notice drift per the signals above, pause your current
   work and use `AskUserQuestion`:

   ```
   AskUserQuestion({
     questions: [{
       question: "This looks unrelated to `<current-slug>` (<one-line drift description>). Want me to create a new flow task for it?",
       header: "New task?",
       options: [
         { label: "Yes, new task",  description: "Pause this work and run the §5.2 intake interview for <derived-name>" },
         { label: "No, stay here",  description: "Keep the work under <current-slug> — I understand this is still in scope" },
         { label: "Later",          description: "Note it in an update on <current-slug> and carry on for now" }
       ],
       multiSelect: false
     }]
   }))
   ```

2. **On "Yes, new task":** enter the §5.2 task-intake interview.
   Derive a task name from what you just observed (e.g. "Fix
   rate-limiter bug I stumbled on while reviewing PRs").
   Use the bound task's project only if the new work
   genuinely belongs there; otherwise leave it floating or attach to
   a different project per the user's answer during intake. After
   the new task is saved, use `AskUserQuestion` (header:
   "Open it now?", options: "Yes, open it" / "No, keep in backlog")
   to offer `flow do <new-slug>` so the follow-on work gets its own
   transcript.

3. **On "No, stay here":** accept the user's judgement and continue.
   Consider this a signal to update your mental model of what the
   bootstrapped task includes — don't re-ask on the same thread of
   work in the same session.

4. **On "Later":** use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Drop a note?",
   options: "Yes, save a drift note" / "No, just continue") to offer
   writing a short progress note on the current task capturing the
   drift observation ("noticed X while doing Y; may need its own
   task"), then continue with the original work.

**Why this lives in the skill, not the hook:** the hook's only
guaranteed side-effect is injecting text at session start. Detection
requires inspecting what you've done this session (edits, debugging
topics) — that state only exists inside the running conversation. The
hook's job is to make sure the skill is loaded; the skill is what
runs the check.

**Note:** "the bootstrapped task" includes playbook-run tasks. The
triggers and recipe are identical for playbook-run sessions —
edits/debugging that drift outside the playbook's scope warrant the
same prompt.

### 4.12 Add a playbook

**Triggers:** "add a playbook", "create a playbook for X",
"track this as a playbook", "this is something I'll re-run".

**The interview is the whole point** (same philosophy as §4.2 task intake — you interview, then write down what the user said; you do NOT solution during intake).

**Sections to ask, ONE AT A TIME, in this order:**

1. **What?** One sentence describing what each run does.
2. **Why?** Why this playbook exists and what value it produces.
3. **Where?** Work_dir for runs (use §6 recipe).
4. **Each run does** — concrete steps every invocation performs. Bullet
   form. Replaces "Done when" from task intake.
5. **Out of scope?** Non-goals. Optional.
6. **Signals to watch for** — observable conditions that should change
   the run's behavior or trigger an escalation. Replaces "Open
   questions" — playbooks have long lifespans so prospective signals
   matter more than open questions.

**Then before calling `flow add playbook`:**

- Suggest 2-3 slug candidates via `AskUserQuestion` (header:
  "Pick a slug", one option per candidate plus "Other" for custom).
- Project attachment via `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Attach to?",
  one option per existing project plus "None (floating playbook)").
  Skip the question if there are no projects.
- `--mkdir` if work_dir doesn't exist — use `AskUserQuestion`
  (header: "Create dir?", options: "Yes, create it" / "No, fix the
  path") same as §6 step 6.

**Draft the brief, show to the user**, then use `AskUserQuestion`
(header: "Brief", options: "Save it" / "Revise") to confirm. Do not
run `flow add playbook` until the user picks "Save it". Then run it
and overwrite the stub `brief.md` with the full content (Read once,
then Edit/Write — same pattern as §5.2). Use the playbook brief
template from §7.

After save, use `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Run it now?", options:
"Run it now" / "Just save the definition") to offer the first run.
On "Run it now", proceed to §4.13. On "Just save the definition",
stop.

### 4.13 Run a playbook

**Triggers — any of these means "run `flow run playbook <slug>`":**
- "run the X playbook" / "trigger X" / "fire the X playbook"
- "fire the X agent" (legacy term users may use — playbook is the canonical name)
- "start a run of X" / "kick off X"
- A bare `flow run playbook X` typed as command

**Recipe:**

1. Ask session-mode (Regular vs Skip permissions) via AskUserQuestion —
   reuses the §4.4 pattern. Skip if the user already specified. If the
   user asks for Codex, append `--agent codex`.
2. Run: `flow run playbook <slug>` (with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
   if chosen, and `--agent codex` if requested).
3. The command creates a kind=playbook_run task, snapshots the brief,
   and spawns a terminal tab. The new tab will boot the flow skill via its
   bootstrap prompt and execute against the snapshotted brief.

**Anti-pattern (per §8):** never auto-fire. Manual trigger only. Even if
the user mentions a playbook name in passing, do not run it without an
explicit verb ("run", "trigger", "fire", "start").

#### Persisting in-run adjustments back to the playbook

A playbook run executes against a **frozen snapshot** of the playbook's
`brief.md`. Sometimes during a run the user adjusts the procedure —
"let's always do X here", "change the approach for step 3", "this step
should also check Y". When that happens, the run-time session has two
sources of truth diverging:

- The run's `brief.md` snapshot — what THIS run is executing against
- The playbook's live `brief.md` — what FUTURE runs will inherit

If the user's adjustment is meant to apply only to this run, do nothing
extra. But if it's a procedural improvement worth keeping, the live
playbook brief should be updated — otherwise next week's run forgets
the lesson.

**Trigger this prompt when:** the user makes a non-trivial procedural
change during a run — adds a step, changes the approach for a step,
adds a signal to watch for, narrows or expands scope. Tiny tactical
tweaks ("skip step 4 today, the system is offline") don't count;
durable changes do.

**Recipe — use AskUserQuestion:**

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Persist this change to the playbook so future runs include it?",
    header: "Persist?",
    options: [
      { label: "Persist to playbook",  description: "Edit playbooks/<slug>/brief.md so future runs inherit the change" },
      { label: "Just this run",         description: "Apply to this run only; future runs continue with the existing playbook" },
      { label: "Both — persist + note", description: "Edit the live playbook AND log the rationale in playbooks/<slug>/updates/" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

**Important rules:**

- **Never edit the run-task's own `brief.md`** to change future behavior.
  That's a frozen snapshot — editing it has no effect on future runs and
  obscures what the run actually executed against.
- **The live playbook brief lives at `~/.flow/playbooks/<slug>/brief.md`.**
  Edit that file directly when persisting.
- **The "Both" option** is the right answer when the change is worth
  capturing AND its rationale is non-obvious from the diff alone — the
  update note explains *why*, the brief edit captures *what*.
- **Do not auto-persist without asking.** Even a clear improvement may
  be deliberately scoped to this run by the user.

#### First-run capture (special case)

The **first run** of a playbook is where the actual procedure
crystallizes. The brief was written aspirationally; concrete commands,
scripts, decision rules, and edge cases get discovered for the first
time. Without active capture, all that learning evaporates when the run
closes.

**Detection:** the bootstrap prompt sets a banner — "⚡ THIS IS THE
FIRST RUN OF THIS PLAYBOOK ⚡" — when the run-task is the only
non-archived `kind=playbook_run` row for its `playbook_slug`. Treat
that as your signal.

**Behavior on first run — be more proactive than usual:**

1. **Scripts and commands.** When you write a script, settle on a
   concrete command, or develop a snippet that wasn't in the brief,
   pause and AskUserQuestion *immediately*:

   ```
   AskUserQuestion({
     questions: [{
       question: "Capture this <script|command|decision> back to the playbook?",
       header: "Capture?",
       options: [
         { label: "Add to playbook brief",  description: "Append/edit the relevant section of playbooks/<slug>/brief.md — future runs see it inline" },
         { label: "Save as sidecar file",   description: "Write to playbooks/<slug>/<topic>.md (e.g., decision-tree.md, sample-script.md). Surfaced under other: for on-demand load" },
         { label: "Just this run",          description: "Apply locally; don't change the playbook (rare for first run)" }
       ],
       multiSelect: false
     }]
   })
   ```

2. **Edge cases / signals.** When the user hits a condition the brief
   didn't anticipate, AskUserQuestion whether to add it to the "Signals
   to watch for" section of the live brief.

3. **End-of-run capture sweep.** Before `flow done`, AskUserQuestion:

   > "Capture anything from this run back to the playbook before closing?"
   > - Yes — walk me through what to capture
   > - No, close out as-is

   On "walk me through": list the candidate captures (scripts produced,
   decisions made, edge cases hit, commands actually used). Offer each
   one via AskUserQuestion individually so the user can opt in
   per-item.

**Sidecar files vs brief edits:**

- **Brief edits** are for *procedural* changes — additions to "Each run
  does", new "Signals to watch for", clarified scope. Inline content
  that every future run benefits from seeing during bootstrap.
- **Sidecar files** (`playbooks/<slug>/<topic>.md`) are for *artifacts*
  — scripts, decision trees, sample outputs, reference tables. Things
  that future runs may or may not need; they're surfaced under `other:`
  in `flow show playbook` and loaded on-demand by the run session.

**Capture-back is a primary deliverable of the first run.** Not an
afterthought. After the first run, the playbook should be
substantially more concrete than it started.

### 4.14 Substantive-unrelated-work check (passive, ongoing)

This is a **passive workflow** that runs alongside every other workflow.
It fires when substantive work emerges that doesn't belong to the
current task binding.

**Triggers (any one is enough):**

- In a **dispatch session** (`flow show task` reports unbound):
  - You've been in active design / brainstorming / debugging
    discussion for ≥ 2 turns about a concrete topic, OR
  - You've made any Edit/Write tool calls, OR
  - You've invoked a process skill (`superpowers:brainstorming`,
    `superpowers:writing-plans`, `superpowers:executing-plans`,
    `superpowers:systematic-debugging`,
    `superpowers:test-driven-development`) — a process-skill invocation
    is itself a substantive-work signal.
- In a **bound session** (`flow show task` resolves a task): same triggers as §4.11
  (work moved off the bootstrapped task's scope).

**NOT a trigger:**

- One-off question answered in a single turn.
- Reading files / running queries to inform an answer.
- The very first message after session start (you don't yet know if
  this is one-off or substantive).

**Recipe:**

1. Pause current work.
2. Run `flow list tasks --status in-progress` and
   `flow list tasks --status backlog --priority high` to see candidates.
3. Use AskUserQuestion to offer three options:
   - **Create a new flow task** for this work — run §4.2 intake.
     §4.2's "Open now?" tail will offer **Continue here (bind this
     session)** alongside new-tab and backlog (since this is a
     dispatch session). Continue-here is usually the right pick
     from this path: substantive work has already started in this
     conversation, and binding preserves the transcript.
   - **Switch to an existing task** — list candidates as options. On
     selection, by default spawn `flow do <slug>` (new tab). Note:
     if THIS session is already bound to another task, do NOT offer
     `flow do --here <existing-slug>` as a sub-option — the binary
     would refuse (session_id uniqueness invariant), and even
     `--force` doesn't override it.
   - **Proceed ad-hoc** (user accepts no resumability, no context
     accumulation).

**Process-skill ordering:** when a process skill triggers this check,
load the skill first (so the user sees the right tool engage), then
**before** taking the skill's first concrete action, run the check.
If the user picks "create new task" or "switch to existing task," the
process skill resumes inside the new session, not this one.

**Important: this is an ongoing check, not one-shot.** Re-evaluate the
triggers each turn — especially when transitioning into design /
implementation / debugging work. The SessionStart hook gets you the
first check; you are responsible for every subsequent check.
Re-evaluate on every turn.

### 4.15 Upgrade flow itself

**Triggers:** "update flow", "upgrade flow", "is there a new version
of flow", "new flow version", "what version am I on", "what's the
latest flow", "flow is stale", a bare `flow --version` typed as
command-like input. Also fires when the SessionStart hook reports
`flow-version-stale: <new-version>` in its additionalContext (the
hook does an at-most-once-per-day cached check against GitHub
releases) — when you see that signal, proactively offer the upgrade
via `AskUserQuestion`.

**Recipe:**

1. Run `flow --version` to capture the currently-installed version.
2. The canonical install/upgrade procedure lives in the README at
   `https://github.com/Facets-cloud/flow`. Use the `Read` tool /
   `WebFetch` to read the **Install** and **Upgrade** sections —
   they're the source of truth for the binary download URL,
   architecture flag (`arm64` for Apple Silicon, `amd64` for Intel),
   and the `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` workaround for unsigned
   binaries. Do not invent download URLs; read them from the README.
3. Download the new binary per the README and replace the existing
   one (typically at `/usr/local/bin/flow`; confirm with
   `which flow` if unsure).
4. Run `flow skill update` to refresh the embedded skill on disk and
   re-wire both the SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks in
   `~/.claude/settings.json`. (The auto-upgrade path runs the same
   refresh on the next `flow` invocation, but explicit is better and
   surfaces any errors immediately.)
5. Run `flow --version` again and confirm the version changed. If it
   did not change, the binary on `$PATH` is still the old one —
   check `which flow` against the path you wrote to.

**Anti-patterns:**

- **Do not invent download URLs.** Read them from the README at
  `https://github.com/Facets-cloud/flow`. Releases are at
  `/releases/latest/download/`; the README has the exact form.
- **Do not run `flow skill install` on an existing install** — it
  errors. Use `flow skill update` for the refresh path.
- **Do not skip the `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine`** step on a
  freshly-downloaded binary — Gatekeeper will refuse to run it
  otherwise.

### 4.16a Tagging tasks

**Triggers:** "tag this task as X", "add a tag X to <task>", "what
tags does <task> have", "show all tags", "list my tags", "what tags
are in use", "find all tasks tagged X".

**What tags are:** free-form single-string labels attached to tasks
for cross-cutting identification — `#frontend`, `#urgent`,
`#tech-debt`, `#h2-2026`, `#triage`, `#research`. Stored normalized
(lowercase, trimmed). Many-to-many: a task can have any number of
tags, a tag can be on any number of tasks. Tags are *single strings*
— if you want kv-style semantics (`type:bug`, `priority:p0`), use a
`key:value` colon convention inside the string. Don't introduce a
parallel kv schema.

**The vocabulary discipline rule:** before suggesting a new tag for
a task, ALWAYS run `flow list tags` first. That command lists every
tag in use across non-archived tasks with a per-tag task count. Reuse
existing tags whenever they fit — the user's tag vocabulary is more
useful when it stays consistent. Inventing a synonym (e.g.
`#frontend` when `#ui` already has 8 tasks) fragments the tag space
and makes filtering useless.

**Recipe — add tags:**

1. Run `flow list tags` and read the output. Note any existing tag
   that matches the user's intent.
2. If a good match exists, propose it via AskUserQuestion (header:
   "Use existing tag?", options: existing-tag candidates + "Use a
   new tag"). Skip this step if the user already named the exact
   tag.
3. Run `flow update task <ref> --tag <tag1> --tag <tag2> ...`.
   `--tag` is repeatable — pass it once per tag value. Tags are
   normalized to lowercase + trimmed; idempotent on duplicates.

**Recipe — remove or clear:**

- `flow update task <ref> --remove-tag <tag1> --remove-tag <tag2>`
  removes specific tags (also repeatable).
- `flow update task <ref> --clear-tags` removes all tags from a task.
  Confirm via AskUserQuestion (header: "Clear all tags?", options:
  "Yes, clear all" / "No, name specific tags") before mutating —
  clearing is destructive and per §8 every state mutation deserves
  a click.
- `--clear-tags` and `--remove-tag` are mutually exclusive (clear
  removes everything anyway). `--clear-tags --tag <new>` is allowed
  and means "wipe and replace with `<new>`" — useful for retagging.

**Recipe — find tasks by tag:**

- `flow list tasks --tag <tag>` filters the task list to that tag.
  Combine with `--status`, `--project`, `--priority`, etc.

**Display:** list/show output renders tags as `#tag1 #tag2` tokens
trailing the row. The hashtag prefix is render-only — do not type
`#` into `--tag` values (it would be normalized away, but treat the
rule as "tag values are unprefixed strings").

**Anti-patterns:**

- **Do not invent new tags without checking `flow list tags` first.**
  The vocabulary discipline rule isn't optional.
- **Do not use kv-style alternative storage.** Single strings with
  `key:value` convention are the canonical form.
- **Do not auto-tag.** Always confirm with the user before adding
  tags they didn't explicitly name. The exception is when the user's
  request literally names the tag ("tag this `#frontend`").

### 4.16 Bind an in-flight Claude/Codex session to a task

**Triggers:** "bind this session to <task>", "track this session
under <task>", "attach this conversation to <task>", "this session is
for <task>". Also fires when the user manually creates a flow task
while already deep in an ad-hoc Claude or Codex session and wants future
`flow do <slug>` to resume *this* conversation rather than start a
new one. The §4.2 "Continue here" option is the most common entry
point.

**Recipe:** if the target task already exists (or you just created
it via §4.2), run:

```
flow do --here <slug>
```

`flow do --here` reads the current session id from the active agent
host (`$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` for Claude Code, `$CODEX_THREAD_ID`
for Codex), validates it, stores the matching `session_provider`,
and writes the id to `tasks.session_id`. Side effects: status flips
backlog → in-progress (the session-id invariant requires it). No
terminal spawn happens; the binding is the only mutation.

**Safety properties enforced by the binary** (you don't have to
police these):

- Refuses if no supported current-session env var is set, or if the
  exposed id is malformed. Claude ids must be v4 UUIDs; Codex thread
  ids must be UUID-shaped.
- Refuses if **THIS session** is already bound to a different task.
  `--force` does NOT override this — session_id uniqueness is
  structural. The user must release the prior binding first or
  open the target in a new tab via `flow do <slug>`.
- Refuses if **the target task** already has a different
  session_id bound. `--force` overrides this case (and only this
  case), but the user has been told it orphans the target's
  prior session.
- No-op (idempotent) if the target is already bound to this same
  session.
- Refuses if the target is `done`. Reopen via
  `flow update task <slug> --status in-progress` first; the
  prior session_id is preserved across done, so `--here` becomes
  unnecessary after reopen.

**Anti-patterns:**

- **Do not invent or guess the session id.** The host env var is the
  only authoritative source.
- **Do not bind without confirming the task slug.** If multiple
  tasks could plausibly own this conversation, AskUserQuestion to
  pick.
- **Do not run `--here` from a different tab to attach a session
  in another tab.** The env var is per-process; `--here` always
  attaches the *current* session. To attach a session in another
  tab, switch to that tab and run `flow do --here` there.

### 4.17 Delegate to a child task (orchestration)

**Triggers:** "spawn a child to do X", "have another agent handle X
while I keep going", "split this off into a parallel task", "delegate
this part", "kick off Y in the background and tell me when it's done",
"send a message to <task>", "wait for <task> to finish before I
continue", or a bare `flow spawn|tell|wait` invocation.

flow supports a small orchestration vocabulary so a parent agent can
delegate self-contained work to a child agent in another tab,
coordinate with a sibling task you're not actively driving, or block
until something finishes. There is **no in-session pane sharing** the
way herdr has — each agent gets its own tab, talks to siblings via
durable filesystem channels, and signals state through the same
`/ws/events` stream the UI consumes.

**The three primitives:**

| Command | Purpose | Synchronous? |
|---|---|---|
| `flow spawn <name> --parent <slug> --prompt "..."` | Create a child task with the parent linkage set and immediately open it in a new tab. The prompt becomes the child's brief What section. | No — fires the child off in its own tab |
| `flow tell <slug> "..."` | Append a message to the receiving task's inbox.md; the bound agent picks it up at its next SessionStart. | No — receiver reads on next session turn |
| `flow wait <slug> --until <state>` | Block the caller's terminal until the named task reaches the requested state. | Yes — blocks via WS subscription |

**When to use which:**

- **`spawn`** when the work is genuinely independent — a self-contained
  investigation, a build, a long-running script, a code review. The
  child gets its own brief, transcript, updates, and inbox.
- **`tell`** when a sibling task already exists and you want to nudge
  it with a follow-up instruction without spawning a new conversation.
  The receiver doesn't get the message immediately — it lands on the
  next session start (often after the receiver's current turn ends).
- **`wait`** when you need to gate parent progress on a child's
  completion. Prefer this over polling `flow show task` in a loop —
  `wait` subscribes to the live event stream and exits the moment the
  state changes.

**Recipe — typical orchestration pattern:**

```
# (1) Delegate a self-contained subtask
flow spawn "review-coverage" --parent oauth-budget \
    --prompt "Audit test coverage in src/api/ and report gaps as an update on this task before closing"

# (2) Continue parent work; later, block until child is done
flow wait review-coverage --until done --timeout 30m

# (3) Read what the child accomplished
flow transcript review-coverage --compact
# (the parent agent can also inspect ~/.flow/tasks/review-coverage/updates/)

# (4) Mid-flight nudge — change scope before the child is done
flow tell review-coverage "also check the legacy auth shim in src/legacy/"
```

**Triggers and proposals — what the parent agent should offer:**

When the user describes a workflow that fits the spawn/tell/wait
shape, surface the orchestration option via AskUserQuestion. Examples:

- *"Can you also review the test coverage while you're at it?"* —
  ambiguous between "do it inline" and "delegate to a child."
  Use AskUserQuestion (header: "How to handle?", options:
  "Do it here" / "Spawn a child task").
- *"Run the migration script and tell me when it's done."* — long
  blocking work the parent doesn't need to babysit. Propose
  `flow spawn migration-run --prompt "..."` + `flow wait migration-run
  --until done`.
- *"Pass this note to the budget-task agent."* — explicit sibling
  message. Run `flow tell budget-task "<note>"` directly; this is one
  of the rare cases where the user has named the action AND the
  target, so no further AskUserQuestion is needed.

**Anti-patterns (orchestration-specific):**

- **Do not spawn for tiny work.** If the subtask is one tool call or
  one short answer, do it inline. Spawning creates a permanent task
  row, a brief, and an entire transcript — overhead the user pays
  forever in their list view. Spawn for work that has its own
  meaningful "done" definition.
- **Do not poll `flow show task` in a loop instead of using `flow
  wait`.** Every poll is a DB hit and a token in your context;
  `flow wait` is event-driven and costs nothing while idle.
- **Do not `tell` an agent you expect to act immediately.** Inbox
  delivery is async — the receiver sees the message at its next
  SessionStart, which may not be for minutes. If you need a real-time
  hand-off, use `flow spawn` for a fresh agent or wait for a turn
  boundary on the sibling.
- **Do not bypass the user's confirmation when proposing orchestration.**
  If the work could plausibly be done inline OR delegated, ask via
  AskUserQuestion. The user often prefers inline for quick tasks.
- **Do not edit `parent_slug` by hand.** It's set by `flow spawn` at
  creation time, and existing tasks can be re-parented with
  `flow update task <child> --parent <parent>` or detached with
  `flow update task <child> --clear-parent`.

**Reading children:**

When the current bound task has children (visible in `flow show task`
output under a `children:` section, or in the UI as a tree), and the
user asks something like "what's status on the review-coverage task?",
prefer one of:

- `flow show task review-coverage` for the brief/updates/status
- `flow transcript review-coverage --compact` for the recent dialog
- `flow list tasks --parent <this-slug>` to scan all siblings

**Inbox housekeeping:**

When THIS task has unseen inbox entries, the SessionStart hook
prepends an `INBOX UPDATED: <slug> has new message(s) ...` notice with
the path to inbox.md. Read it BEFORE proceeding — those messages are
typically the parent's adjustments to scope or instructions you
haven't acted on yet. After reading, you don't need to do anything
special; the column `tasks.inbox_seen_at` is already bumped to the
inbox mtime by the hook, so the same messages won't re-fire on the
next session start.

## 6. The `work_dir` question — rules

When you're about to ask the user "where does this task live?", run
these steps BEFORE asking, so the question is informed:

1. **Run `flow workdir list`.** Fuzzy-match the task name against
   registered nicknames and paths. If you get an obvious match (e.g.
   task "Add OAuth to budgeting-app" and a registered workdir named
   `budgeting-app`), propose that path via `AskUserQuestion` (header:
   "Use this path?", options: "Yes, use `<path>`" / "Pick a different
   path"). On "Pick a different path", continue to step 2.
2. **If no local match, check GitHub via `gh`.** Run `gh repo list
   --limit 50 --json name,owner,description`. If any repo name or
   description plausibly matches the task, present the top 3 via
   `AskUserQuestion` (header: "Which repo?") with one option per
   candidate (label = `<repo-name>`, description = repo description)
   plus a "None of these — use a path instead" option. If the user
   picks a repo, offer (via `AskUserQuestion`, header: "Clone it?",
   options: "Yes, clone to `~/code/<name>`" / "No, I'll handle it")
   to run `gh repo clone <owner>/<repo> ~/code/<name>` and, after
   clone, run `flow workdir add ~/code/<name>` so next time it's a
   local match.
3. **If `gh` isn't authenticated** (command errors with an auth
   message), fall back gracefully via `AskUserQuestion` (header:
   "GitHub unreachable", options: "Give me a path" / "Make it
   floating"). On "Give me a path", prompt the user for an absolute
   path (this single text input is fine — there are no enumerable
   options). On "Make it floating", skip work_dir entirely.
4. **If the user wants a floating task** (no repo), skip the question
   entirely and let `flow add task` auto-create
   `~/.flow/tasks/<slug>/workspace/`.
5. **Never guess a path.** Don't invent `~/code/foo` because the task
   name sounds like "foo". Always confirm via `AskUserQuestion`.
6. **If the path doesn't exist**, use `AskUserQuestion` (header:
   "Create dir?", options: "Yes, create it" / "No, fix the path")
   to ask whether to pass `--mkdir`. On "Yes", append `--mkdir` to
   the `flow add task` invocation. On "No", loop back to ask for a
   corrected path.

## 7. The task brief format

Use this as a literal template when writing `brief.md` files. Section
headings are fixed; content is whatever came out of the interview.

```markdown
# <task name, verbatim>

## What
<one sentence from the interview, no editorializing>

## Why
<short paragraph capturing the user's reason>

## Where
work_dir: <absolute path>

## Done when
- <bullet 1 from acceptance criteria>
- <bullet 2>
- <bullet 3>

## Out of scope
- <non-goal 1>

## Open questions
- <question 1>
- <question 2>

---
*Before you start on this task, read CLAUDE.md in the work_dir and any
nested CLAUDE.md files in the subtree you plan to modify. Then read
every file under `updates/` (if any exist) to catch up on prior
progress.*
```

**Thin task brief (intake-minimal):**

```markdown

*Deferred — fill in at task start.*

## Where

## Done when
*Deferred — fill in at task start.*

A section is "deferred" if its body is the literal string
`*Deferred — fill in at task start.*` or `*Deferred*`. The bootstrap
session detects this and offers the user a deferred-section prompt
(§9).

If a section has no content, leave the heading with an italic "none"
underneath. Don't omit headings — the parallel structure makes the
briefs scannable.

Projects use a shorter template: `What / Why / Where / Scope`. No
"Done when", no "Open questions" (projects are ongoing).

**Playbook brief template:**

```markdown
# <name>

## What
<one sentence describing what each run does>

## Why
<short paragraph>

## Where
work_dir: <absolute path>

## Each run does
- <step 1>
- <step 2>
- <step 3>

## Out of scope
- <non-goal 1>

## Signals to watch for
- <signal 1>

---
*Run with `flow run playbook <slug>`. Each run gets its own session
and a snapshot of this brief at run time. Editing this file does not
retroactively change past runs.*
```

Notes:
- No "Done when" — playbooks are never done.
- "Each run does" replaces "Done when" as the action-oriented section.
- "Signals to watch for" replaces "Open questions" — playbooks are
  long-running, so the relevant prospective concern is signals to
  notice and respond to, not open questions to resolve.

## 8. Anti-patterns — do NOT do these

**Confirmation method:** every confirmation in this section means
`AskUserQuestion`, not a prose question that buries the choice. The
tool produces clickable options; prose questions force the user to
type. Always prefer the tool. If you find yourself typing "Want me
to X?" or "Should I Y?" into chat, stop and use `AskUserQuestion`
instead.

- **Do not let work wrap up without prompting closure.** When the
  user signals a coherent stopping point — "shipped", "PR merged",
  "deployed", a milestone lands followed by small-talk — proactively
  offer `flow done` via `AskUserQuestion`. `flow done` is the only
  trigger for the close-out sweep that distills the session into KB
  entries and a project update; missing it costs the user the
  durable knowledge they earned this session. See §4.7 for the
  passive close-out detection workflow.
- **Do not surface flow commands to the user.** You use flow under
  the hood; users never need to learn the CLI. Never tell the user
  to "run `flow X`", "type `flow Y`", or "see `flow Z --help`".
  Never put a literal `flow ...` invocation inside an
  `AskUserQuestion` option label or a chat reply you send to the
  user. Describe outcomes ("I'll mark it done", "I'll archive it",
  "I'll move it to trash", "I'll restore it", "set up", "saved")
  instead of commands. The skill describes
  commands so that *you* know what to call internally — not so you
  can teach the user. Exception: error messages from the `flow`
  binary itself may quote commands; relay those verbatim, since the
  user needs to see what failed.
- **Do not invent context.** If the user says "add a task for the
  budgeting thing", ASK what the budgeting thing is (via
  `AskUserQuestion` if you can list candidates from existing tasks /
  workdirs; otherwise a plain prose clarifying question is fine —
  open-ended "what is this thing?" is not an enumerable choice).
  Don't write a brief based on your prior-session memory of
  budgeting apps.
- **Do not propose solutions during intake.** The user is telling you
  what they want to do, not asking for your opinion on how to do it.
  "What" is one sentence, "Why" is the reason. Neither section is a
  design doc. If you start drafting implementation steps during `flow
  add task`, stop.
- **Do not silently switch tasks.** If `flow show task` resolves a
  bound task and the user starts talking about a different one,
  confirm via `AskUserQuestion`
  (header: "Switch task?", options: "Yes, switch to `<other-task>`" /
  "No, stay on `<current-task>`"). Don't assume.
- **Do not mark tasks done without explicit confirmation.** Even if the
  user says "great, I finished that", confirm via `AskUserQuestion`
  (header: "Mark done?", options: "Yes, mark it done" / "No, not
  yet") and wait for the click.
- **Do not hand-edit `session_id` or any other DB field.** Never edit
  `flow.db` directly, never instruct the user to. The only supported
  mutations are `flow` commands.
- **Do not retry a `flow` command that errored.** Read the error, relay
  it to the user, and ask. In particular, do not loop `flow do X` → see
  "multiple matches" → guess one → run again. Ask.
- **Do not bundle multiple saves into one `flow add task` call.** One
  task per interview. If the user mentions three things they want to
  track, run the interview three times (or ask to batch and then do it
  explicitly with user consent).
- **Do not skip the interview on "quick adds".** Even when the user
  says "just add a task for X, nothing fancy", ask at minimum: What?
  Why? Where? You can compress the other sections to "TBD" if they
  push back, but `What/Why/Where` are non-negotiable.
- **Do not overwrite an existing `brief.md` without checking what's
  there.** `flow add task` writes a stub. You overwrite that stub
  (Read once, then Edit/Write). If the Read shows real content
  rather than the expected stub (e.g. the user edited between add
  and your call), merge thoughtfully and confirm with the user
  before writing.
- **Do not forget to offer progress notes.** After a long working
  session, the user will forget to log what they did. At natural
  breakpoints, proactively use `AskUserQuestion` (header:
  "Save note?", options: "Yes, save a note" / "No, skip it") to
  prompt — never a prose "want me to save a note?" question.
- **Do not silently continue scope-drifted work under the bootstrapped
  task.** When the work genuinely moves off the bound task (new repo,
  new product, new line of investigation sustained over multiple
  turns — see §5.11 for signals), surface the drift via
  `AskUserQuestion` and offer to branch into a new task. Letting
  unrelated work accumulate under the wrong task poisons that task's
  transcript and buries decisions the user will later want to find.
- **Do not auto-fire `flow run playbook`.** Playbooks are
  manual-trigger only. Even if a user mentions a playbook by name in
  passing, do NOT run it without an explicit verb ("run", "trigger",
  "fire", "start").
- **Do not edit a run-task's `brief.md` to change the playbook's
  behavior for future runs.** That brief is a frozen snapshot. To
  change behavior, edit the playbook's `brief.md` and start a new
  run.
- **Do not propose scheduling during playbook intake.** Scheduled
  invocation is out of scope for v1; playbooks are manual.

## 9. The execution-session bootstrap contract

When `flow do <task>` spawns a Claude session in a new terminal tab, it
pre-allocates a UUID, writes it to `tasks.session_id` before spawning,
and passes it to `claude --session-id <uuid>`. This makes the session's
jsonl file appear at the deterministic path
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`. For Codex sessions
(`flow do <task> --agent codex`), Codex owns the session id; flow launches
interactive `codex`, then captures the generated id from Codex's JSONL
session store and writes it back to `tasks.session_id`. During that capture
window a Codex task can be `in-progress` with an empty `session_id`.

Subsequent `flow do <same-task>` calls read `session_provider` and
`session_id`, then spawn either `claude --resume <uuid>` or
`codex resume <id>` to continue the same conversation.

**If you are the execution session spawned by `flow do`:**

Do ALL of the following in order, before touching any code or
proposing any plan:

1. **Invoke the flow skill via the `Skill` tool.** The `flow hook
   session-start` output already names this step, but the hook is
   belt-and-braces — the Skill tool is the authoritative way to load
   the operating manual that governs workflows, KB discipline, and
   scope-creep detection.

2. **Load the task context:**
   ```
   flow show task
   ```
   From its output, use the `Read` tool on:
   - The file at the `brief:` path (the task brief — the problem
     statement the user captured when creating this task).
   - Every file listed under `updates:` (prior progress notes, in
     chronological order — skim for blockers and decisions).

   **Do NOT read the `kb:` files at bootstrap.** They're lazy-loaded
   on demand — see §5.10 for when to actually Read them.

   **If `flow show task` indicates `kind: playbook_run`:** also run
   `flow show playbook <playbook-slug>` first (for context: the playbook's
   intent and recent runs). Note any files under its `other:` section —
   they're sidecar references you can load on demand. Then read your
   task's `brief.md` — that's the snapshot taken when this run started,
   and it's your authoritative instructions. The playbook's live
   `brief.md` may have evolved since; you don't need to re-read it.

   **Files listed under `other:`** in any `flow show` output (task,
   project, or playbook) are sidecar references — research notes, decision
   trees, design docs, etc. dropped into the entity's directory. Do **not**
   read them eagerly. Read them on demand when something in the brief, in
   user input, or in the work makes them relevant. This matches the
   lazy-load principle for KB files (§5.10 in the skill, §4.10 in the
   section numbering).

3. **Load the parent project context, if any.** If `flow show task`
   printed a `project:` line that isn't `(floating)`, run:
   ```
   flow show project <project-slug>
   ```
   (or just `flow show project` — it defaults to the bound task's project).
   From its output, use `Read` on:
   - The file at its `brief:` path (the project brief — overarching
     context, goals, scope shared across sibling tasks).
   - Every file listed under its `updates:` (project-level progress
     notes — often capture cross-task decisions and blockers that
     matter for your task even if your task's own updates don't
     mention them).

   Again, skip the project's `kb:` section at bootstrap.

4. **Load repo conventions.** Read `AGENTS.md` and/or `CLAUDE.md` in
   your `work_dir` (if present), plus any nested convention files under
   subdirectories you plan to modify. These are authoritative for build
   commands, test commands, style, and gotchas — they override any
   assumption you might make from the brief.

5. **Only then begin work.** If any brief section is blank or
   unclear, ASK the user before inferring. If the user didn't
   specify a "Done when" in the brief, confirm acceptance criteria
   with them before making changes.

**Throughout the session**, watch for new KB-worthy facts per §5.10 and
append them to the matching `kb/*.md` file on the fly — no permission
needed, no interview required. Just write and quietly note what you
recorded. And lazy-read any kb file when you hit a question that
actually needs that context — not before.

### Deferred-section prompt

If any section body in your brief is the literal `*Deferred — fill in at
task start.*` or `*Deferred*`, pause before doing any work and offer the
user (via AskUserQuestion):

- **Fill in now** — run a mini-§4.2 interview for just the missing
  sections (Why, Done when, Out of scope, Open questions). Save the
  filled-in brief by overwriting the existing `brief.md`.
- **Skip — proceed** — accept that scope is implicit. Reasonable for
  small/known tasks.

This shifts the intake burden from intake-time to task-start-time, where
the user has more context.

Applies only to regular tasks (kind=regular). Playbook-run briefs are
snapshots and should not be edited; if the live playbook brief had
deferred sections, those should have been resolved at playbook intake.

### Cross-task context via transcripts

If you need to understand what happened in a sibling task's session
(e.g. a prior task under the same project made decisions that affect
yours), use:

```
flow transcript <sibling-task-slug>
```

This outputs a readable conversation transcript from that task's agent
session — user messages, assistant messages, tool calls, and results.
Use `--compact` to omit tool results and thinking blocks for a shorter
overview. Pipe through `grep` or `head` if the full transcript is too
long to read at once.

**When to use:** When the brief and updates for a sibling task don't
give you enough context, or when you need to understand specific
implementation decisions made during that task's session.

### Field edits — `flow update task` / `flow update project`

`flow update task` is the canonical lane for in-place field edits on
a task. `flow update project` is the same for project rows (priority
only, for now). All field setters live here — there are no per-field
mini-commands like `flow priority` / `flow due` / `flow waiting` /
`flow assignee` (those used to exist; they were folded into update).

```
flow update task <ref>
    [--work-dir <path>] [--mkdir]
    [--status backlog|in-progress|done]
    [--priority high|medium|low]
    [--assignee <name>] [--clear-assignee]
    [--due-date <date>]   [--clear-due]
    [--parent <task>] [--clear-parent]
    [--waiting "<who or what>"] [--clear-waiting]
    [--tag <t> ...] [--remove-tag <t> ...] [--clear-tags]

flow update project <ref>
    [--priority high|medium|low]
```

When to use which flag:

- **`--work-dir <path>`** — the repo moved on disk (renamed parent,
  moved between drives, cloned to a new path). Pass `--mkdir` if the
  new path doesn't exist yet.
- **`--status <s>`** — primary use case is rolling a `done` task back
  to `in-progress` so `flow do` will reopen it (the do-from-done path
  is gated). Also handy for in-progress → backlog to "demote" a task
  you're not actively working on. Setting backlog → in-progress on a
  non-Codex task with NULL session_id errors with a pointer at `flow do` /
  `flow do --here` — those are the paths that attach an agent session.
  Codex may briefly have NULL session_id only while flow is capturing the
  id after a fresh Codex launch. Setting status to a value it already has
  is a no-op.
- **`--priority <p>`** — change a task or project priority. Same enum
  as creation: high|medium|low.
- **`--assignee <name>` / `--clear-assignee`** — set or clear the task
  assignee. Convention: NULL = "self" (default); any other value =
  "assigned to that name". The list/show output surfaces the assignee
  only when it's non-null.
- **`--due-date <date>` / `--clear-due`** — set or clear the due date.
  Date formats: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `today`, `tomorrow`, weekday names, `Nd`.
- **`--parent <task>` / `--clear-parent`** — set or clear parent/child
  task linkage. Use this for real task-to-task dependencies where the
  child should not start until the parent lands; use `waiting_on` for
  looser external blockers.
- **`--waiting "<X>"` / `--clear-waiting`** — set or clear the
  `waiting_on` freeform note (see §4.6). Status stays in-progress;
  the note is just there to remind the user.

There is **no** `--session-id` flag. The session_id is owned by
`flow do`, Codex capture, or `flow do --here`; manual rewriting was a
foot-gun (silent overwrite of an existing binding) and the lane is gone.
Use `flow do --here <slug>` from inside the Claude or Codex session you want to bind.

At least one field-changing flag must be given. `--work-dir` is an
escape hatch — do not run it as a workaround for a bug in `flow do`;
surface the bug instead.

## 10. How "what task am I on?" gets answered

`tasks.session_provider` plus `tasks.session_id` is the source of truth.
Every Claude Code session has `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` in its env, and Codex
sessions expose `$CODEX_THREAD_ID`. Flow reverse-lookups those values against
`tasks.session_id`. Browser/Codex launches may also set `$FLOW_TASK`, which
`flow show task` uses as a direct fallback before current-session reverse-lookup.
Two implications:

- `flow show task` with no argument resolves the bound task via
  `$FLOW_TASK` or reverse-lookup. So does `flow show project` (it resolves
  the current/bound task's project).
- When saving a progress note, the "current task" is whatever the
  reverse-lookup returns. If `flow show task` errors with
  `not bound to a task`, ask the user which task to attribute it to.

Do not invent your own task binding. Prefer `flow show task` with no
argument; it already handles `$FLOW_TASK` when present and Claude/Codex
reverse-lookup when available.

A session is "bound" when some task carries its session_id (set by
`flow do <slug>` at spawn time, or by `flow do --here <slug>`
retroactively). A session is "dispatch / unbound" when no task does
— `flow show task` errors with a friendly message.

## 11. When in doubt

Ask. The worst outcome is writing a bad brief or silently
mis-attributing a progress note. The second-worst outcome is running
`flow do` on the wrong task. Both are avoided by one clarifying
question. The user's time budget for a clarifying question is vastly
lower than their budget for fixing a wrong save after the fact.

In a dispatch session (no task bound to this session), also re-check
§4.14 (substantive-unrelated-work) on every turn. The skill is
responsible for ongoing detection; the SessionStart hook is only a
one-shot trigger.
