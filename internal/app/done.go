When it does, UPDATE that entry in place to the settled reality (rewrite the plan into the outcome), or remove it if the settled fact is now trivial/obvious. This supersede-in-place is the ONE exception to §4.10's append-only rule and applies ONLY here at close-out. Be conservative: supersede ONLY entries THIS work clearly settled or contradicted; never touch entries you're unsure about, and never delete durable facts that are still true.
