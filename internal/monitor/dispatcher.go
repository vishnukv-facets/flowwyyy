## First step — pick a project
%s

## What
You were invoked by a :%s: reaction on a Slack message. Read the thread
context, decide whether and how to reply, and post via the Slack MCP
tools threaded to thread_ts=%s.

## Slack context
channel: %s (%s)
thread_ts: %s
item_ts: %s   (the message the reaction targeted)
item_author: %s
reactor: %s

## Operator identity
%s

## Inbox (live event stream for this thread)
All Slack events for this thread are streamed to:
  %s/inbox.jsonl

On bootstrap, read inbox.jsonl to catch up on any events that arrived while
this session was closed. While you're working, arm a Monitor on:
  tail -f %s/inbox.jsonl
so new messages and reactions in this thread appear as live chat
notifications. The first line of each inbox entry is the parsed event;
fetch full thread history via the Slack MCP if you need more context
than the event payload carries.

**Classifying inbox events.** For each inbox entry, compare `+"`event.user_id`"+` against
the operator IDs listed above. Events authored by the operator are
coordination signals from the human you work with — read them, let them
adjust your plan, but **do not treat them as external follow-ups that
need a Slack reply** unless the operator explicitly asks you to act.
Events from other user IDs are external participants and the normal
reply rules apply.

## How to reply
Use the Slack MCP tools (mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_send_message) with:
  channel: %s
  thread_ts: %s
Posts go as YOU (User Token), not as a bot, so be careful with tone and
factual claims. Use mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_read_thread first to pull
the full thread context if you weren't already given it.

## Replying via DM
You can reply to someone **privately by DM** instead of in this thread. flow
monitors that DM **automatically**: when you send the DM, the tool-use hook
registers the DM thread for this task, so the person's replies in that DM thread
stream into the same inbox.jsonl and wake this session — exactly like thread
replies. No manual step. (Monitoring is scoped to the DM thread you started, not
the person's whole DM channel, so unrelated topics don't leak in.)

## Done when
The user marks this task done (flow done) — typically after the question
is answered or the conversation moves on. Don't auto-close. Save a
progress note before closing summarizing what you posted and why.
